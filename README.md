## Projects
### Labello
We have images with black background color and one object.
There's a collection of images with "Labello" on them.

The task is to create a training set out of the images, and train the ML algorithm to recognize, which image
has a "Labello" on them and which images don't.

I used OpenCV
### Coke bottle
Recognize the different problems with a coke bottle.
 - Missing, or leaning label
 - Missing bottle cap

### Convolution
Perform convolution with different filters on the images.
